# Mosis3
We placed the src map on github, but this of coucrse needs to be replaced with your own build of the original cbd-master library build

The project consist of 3 files:
- HarmonicOscillator.py
- IntegrationMethods.py
- StiffSystemsOfEquations.py

The model and plot outputs that are generated by each of these files go to the resc map. Here we have 3 different maps
- HO: Stands for Harmonic Oscillator. This contains all the outputs generated by HarmonicOscillator.py
- IM: Stands for Integration Methods. This contains all the outputs generated by IntegrationMethods.py
- SSOE: Stands for Stiff Systems of Equations. This contains all the outputs generated by StiffSystemsOfEquations.py
