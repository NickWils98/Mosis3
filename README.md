# Mosis3
We placed the src map on github, but this of course needs to be replaced with your own build of the original cbd-master library.

The project consist of 3 files:
- HarmonicOscillator.py: Contains all the models for the harmonic oscillator
- IntegrationMethods.py: Contains all the models for the integration methods
- StiffSystemsOfEquations.py: Contains all the models for the stiff systems of equations
- util.py: Contains the run, validity and plot functions used by above python files

The model and plot outputs that are generated by each of these files go to the resc map. Here we have 3 different maps
- HO: Stands for Harmonic Oscillator. This contains all the outputs generated by HarmonicOscillator.py
- IM: Stands for Integration Methods. This contains all the outputs generated by IntegrationMethods.py
- SSOE: Stands for Stiff Systems of Equations. This contains all the outputs generated by StiffSystemsOfEquations.py
